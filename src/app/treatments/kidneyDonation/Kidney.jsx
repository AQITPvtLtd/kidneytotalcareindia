              How do they know if your brain stem has died?

            <p className="text-lg font-bold text-gray-700 mt-1">
              The tests used to determine brain stem death are simple but
              conclusive. They will only be carried out after nephrologist in
              Delhi have established that the patient has suffered irreversible
              brain damage.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg font-bold text-gray-700 mt-1">
              Before the tests are started checks are made to make sure that any
              factors which might affect the tests such as drugs or an extremely
              low body temperature have been eliminated.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg font-bold text-gray-700 mt-1">
              The tests are done at the patient’s bedside. First of all, a torch
              is shone into both eyes to see if the pupils react to the light.
              Then the cornea, which is normally ultra-sensitive, is stroked
              with a tissue or cotton wool. Next, painful pressure is applied to
              the forehead and the nose is pinched. Ice-cold water is then
              syringed into each ear in turn, which would normally cause eye
              movement. A tube is then inserted down the patient’s throat to
              provoke a gagging or coughing response.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg font-bold text-gray-700 mt-1">
              Finally, and most importantly, conditions are created which allow
              the patient to be removed from the ventilator for a short period
              of about ten minutes to see if they show any sign of attempting to
              breathe on their own. Patients who are brain stem dead will not
              react in any way to any of the tests.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg font-bold text-gray-700 mt-1">
              This group of tests is carried out twice, at separate times. They
              are done by two senior doctors with special expertise in this
              area, neither of whom must be a member of the transplant team.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg font-bold text-gray-700 mt-1">
              If the second set of tests confirms no evidence of brain stem
              activity the patient is declared dead.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg font-bold text-gray-700 mt-1">
              The standards for certifying death by brain stem death are strict
              and are accepted medically, legally and ethically in the UK and in
              most other countries in the world.

            <p className="text-lg font-bold text-gray-700 mt-1">
              Kidney Transplant in Delhi is one of the most miraculous
              achievements of modern medicine. But they depend entirely on the
              generosity of donors and their families who are willing to make
              this life-saving or life-enhancing gift to others.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg font-bold text-gray-700 mt-1">
              One donor can save the life of several people, restore the sight
              of two others and improve the quality of life of many more. The
              more people who pledge to donate their organs and tissue after
              their death, the more people stand to benefit. By choosing to join
              the NHS Organ Donor Register you could help to make sure life goes
              on for many others.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg font-bold text-gray-700 mt-1">
              Joining the register records your agreement to the use of your
              organs and tissue for transplantation after your death.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg font-bold text-gray-700 mt-1">
              When you register it is important that you tell those closest to
              you about your decision.

            <p className="text-lg font-bold text-gray-700 mt-1">
              To decide whether or not you wish to become a donor after you have
              died is something very personal and it is important that everyone
              makes their own decision. This booklet contains answers to the
              most commonly asked questions about organ and tissue donation and
              aims to resolve any doubts you might have about leaving a legacy
              of life for others after you die.

              Questions:
            </h1>

            <p className="text-lg font-bold text-gray-700 mt-1">
              <strong> 1.What is organ donation? </strong> <br />
              Organ donation is the gift of an organ to help someone who needs a
              transplant. The generosity of donors and their families enables
              over 3,000 people in India every year to take on a new lease of
              life.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg font-bold text-gray-700 mt-1">
              <strong>2 When were the first organ transplants?</strong> <br />
              The first successful kidney transplant was in 1954. The first
              heart transplant took place in 1967.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg font-bold text-gray-700 mt-1">
              <strong>3. What organs can be transplanted? </strong> <br />
              Kidneys, heart, liver, lungs, pancreas and the small bowel can all
              be transplanted. Techniques are improving all the time and we may
              soon be able to transplant other parts of the body to help even
              more people. <br />
              The first successful cornea transplant was in 1905. Every year
              thousands of people with a severe eye disease or injury have their
              sight restored by donated corneas. Bone, tendons, and cartilage
              are used for reconstruction after an injury or during joint
              replacement surgery. A bone transplant can prevent limb amputation
              in patients suffering from bone cancer.Heart valves are used to
              help children born with heart defects and adults with diseased or
              damaged valves. Skin grafts are used to treat people with severe
              burns.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg font-bold text-gray-700 mt-1">
              <strong>4. What is tissue donation? </strong> <br />
              Tissue donation is the gift of tissue such as corneas, skin, bone,
              tendons, cartilage and heart valves to help others.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg font-bold text-gray-700 mt-1">
              Most people can donate tissue. Unlike organs, it may be possible
              to donate tissue up to 48 hours after a person has died.

              Some bare facts-
            </h1>

            <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mt-2">
              <li>
                Every hour 14 people are dying of road accidents in India. The
                total annual deaths due to road accidents have crossed 1.18 lakh
                in the year 2009, according to the National Crime Records Bureau
                (NCRB).
              </li>
              <li>
                Every year nearly 1.5 lakh new patients requiring kidney
                transplants are added to the inexhaustible patient numbers in
                need of kidney transplant.
              </li>
              <li>
                Majority of us do not have compatible and willing family donors.
                It means if one gets kidney failure it boils down to lifelong
                dialysis or transplant or imminent death.
              </li>
              <li>
                The liver, lung and cardiac failure numbers are no less

              </li>
              <li>
                The economics of demand and supply is totally skewed. This
                encourages unethical practices in which the poor are coerced to
                sell one of his kidneys or a part of his liver. Besides
                exploitation of the poor, there is sexual exploitation too. 85%
                of recipients are males and 90% of organ donors are females.
              </li>
              <li>
                In many developed nations, the concept of implied consent is in
                place. Simplistically it means that the hospital will retrieve
                transplantable organs before declaring a brain stem dead person
                dead unless the relatives explicitly forbid the organ retrieval.
