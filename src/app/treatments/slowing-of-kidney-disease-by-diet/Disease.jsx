              When renal failure reaches an advanced stage, periodic monitoring
              is carried out in a specific consultation for it (ACKD), in which
              more frequent revisions are made and all the complications of
              renal failure are closely controlled and treated (anemia,
              phosphorus, and high potassium, low bicarbonate, etc.) and all the
              factors that can worsen and accelerate the evolution to more
              advanced stages: medications and toxins, high blood pressure,
              obesity, and diet.

            <p className="text-lg font-bold text-gray-700 mt-1">
              Overall, we must say that the patient with chronic renal failure
              should have healthy lifestyle habits and place special emphasis on
              the following factors:

            <p className="text-lg font-bold text-gray-700 mt-1">
              When there is renal failure, most medications need to reduce the
              usual dose to avoid side effects. But some of them can worsen
              kidney function and it is necessary to avoid them. This is the
              case of anti-inflammatories, which are so frequently used to treat
              pain; It is better to use non-anti-inflammatory analgesics
              (paracetamol, metamizole, tramadol) and some antibiotics.

            <p className="text-lg font-bold text-gray-700 mt-1">
              It is advisable to avoid scans with iodinated contrasts, but if
              necessary, it is recommended to apply measures to reduce their
              toxicity.

              In these advanced phases of kidney disease, poorly controlled BP
              is probably the factor that will most influence the faster loss of
              kidney function. It is recommended figures around 130-135 / 80-85
              mmHg; in elderly people, it may be adequate 140-150 / 85 mmHg.
              This is achieved through a diet without salt, which at this time
              is also necessary so that edemas do not appear, thinning if there
              is overweight or obesity, and with medication for its tension.

              There are people in whom the cause of their kidney failure is

              We must make changes in the diet from the initial stages. At the
              beginning are less strict changes limited to moderately decreasing
              salt, avoid foods that contain a lot of phosphorus (cheeses, nuts)
              and slightly decrease the total amount of meat or fish eaten per
              day. Later, in more advanced phases (function below 30%), it will
              be more strict.

              <li>
                The diet should always be without salt to avoid fluid retention
                and poor control of tension.
              </li>
              <li>
                Basically, the diet consists in decreasing the total amount of
                animal proteins that are eaten daily at 0.6 gr / Kg / d, which
                is 40-60 g of protein per day (once the fat and other components
                of the food have been deducted) ) according to the weight of
                each individual.
              </li>
              <li>
                When eating less protein, you also eat less phosphorus which is
                what you are looking for, but you also have to limit the milk to
                two a day (1 glass of milk and/or yogurt) and avoid the cheese
                (it must be exceptional and all case fresh cheese in small
                quantity). In addition, you should avoid other products with
                high phosphorus content such as soft drinks, chocolate, and
                whole drinks. If with the restriction of the diet it is not
                possible to control the levels of phosphorus in the adequate
                limits (lower than 4.5 mg/dl), it will be necessary to associate
                chelating medicines to diminish their absorption in the
                intestine and for that reason, they should always be taken with
                the food.

                The potassium tends to be high and to control it we have to eat
                fewer foods rich in potassium such as fruit and vegetables. It
                is recommended not to take more than 2 pieces of fruit per day,
                preferably pear or apple; Fruits like banana or grape are not
                recommended because of their high potassium content. The rest of
                the fruits occasionally and replacing one of the 2 recommended.
                You can also take fruit in syrup, discarding the broth of the
                preserve. In case, despite all measures, potassium levels are
                above 5.5 meq / l, the chelating medication should be associated
                to reduce intestinal absorption and should be taken with meals.
              </li>
              <li>
                When eating less protein, you may also eat fewer calories.
                Eating fewer calories can make you lose weight and the proteins
                you eat can be used as calories, which could lead to
                malnutrition. You must ensure a minimum of 30 Kilo-calories per
                Kilo of ideal weight (the healthy one for your size). You should
                compensate the calories you do not eat with proteins, with foods
                of higher caloric power (olive oil, sugar, bread, garnish with
                rice, pasta, mayonnaise sauce, jelly, jam, hard candy, honey,
                and syrup, etc.). If it is diabetic, the caloric supplement
                should be based on starches and vegetable fats and not sugars.
