              Peritoneal dialysis is a very simple technique that is performed
              daily at the patientâ€™s home, there are two types: Continuous
              Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis (CAPD) or manual and Automatic
              Peritoneal Dialysis (APD) with machine or cycler.

              It is dialysis performed daily by the patient at home after a
              period of learning. It only requires a sufficient space to store
              the material and a suitable and well-ventilated place to perform
              the technique, which can be the room itself.

            <p className="text-lg font-bold text-gray-700 mt-4">
              It is recommended that there be no animals at home.

            <p className="text-lg font-bold text-gray-700 mt-2">
              The peritoneal fluid is introduced into the peritoneal cavity
              through a soft silicone catheter or tube, which is placed through
              a small surgical incision in the abdomen at least one month before
              use.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg font-bold text-gray-700 mt-2">
              This catheter is hidden under clothing and does not interfere with
              any type of activity. It only requires some simple cleaning care
              that is learned in the training phase.

              It begins when a month after the placement of the catheter. It is
              performed in the Peritoneal Dialysis Unit by the nurse responsible
              for their training. It consists of learning a few simple steps
              perfectly ordered so that during the change of dialysis fluid you
              maintain at all times the cleaning measures necessary to avoid
              infections.

              It is not necessary to have any health knowledge and it can be

              your needs.

              There are two types of peritoneal dialysis:

              <li>
                Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis (CAPD) or Manual.
              </li>
              <li>
                Automatic Peritoneal Dialysis (DPA), with machine or cycler.

            <ol className="list-decimal list-inside text-gray-700 mt-2">
              <li>
                In the CAPD (manual) peritoneal fluid changes are made 3-4 times
                a day. The schedule of exchanges is approximate, depending on
                the routine and unforeseen that may arise, recommending that at
                least the permanence of the liquid is a minimum of 4 hours and a
                maximum of 8 hours.
              </li>
              <li>
                In the DPA (cycler) the periodic changes are made by a machine
                called a cycler during the night while you are sleeping. The
                last fluid change is the one that remains throughout the day in
                the abdomen until night when the cycler empties the abdomen just
                connect.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <h1 className="text-primary font-semibold text-2xl mt-1">
              Regardless of whether you dialyze with a cycler, you must first
              perform manual dialysis training in order to continue dialysis in
              case of machine failure, power outages or weekend trips, etc.

            <h1 className="text-primary font-semibold text-2xl mt-1">
              The DPA (cycler) is especially indicated when you want to maintain
              work activity without interference.

                <li>
                  As it is done by a catheter located in the abdomen, it is not
                  necessary to puncture the veins repeatedly.

                <li>
                  It is a simple technique applicable at any age, which allows a
