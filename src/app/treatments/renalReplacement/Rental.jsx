              How do they know if your brain stem has died?
            </h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">
              The tests used to determine brain stem death are simple but
              conclusive. They will only be carried out after nephrologists in
              Delhi have established that the patient has suffered irreversible
              brain damage.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">
              Before the tests are started, checks are made to ensure that any
              factors which might affect the tests, such as drugs or extremely
              low body temperature, have been eliminated.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">
              The tests are done at the patient’s bedside. First of all, a torch
              is shone into both eyes to see if the pupils react to the light.
              Then, the cornea, which is normally ultra-sensitive, is stroked
              with a tissue or cotton wool. Next, painful pressure is applied to
              the forehead and the nose is pinched. Ice-cold water is then
              syringed into each ear in turn, which would normally cause eye
              movement. A tube is then inserted down the patient’s throat to
              provoke a gagging or coughing response.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">
              Finally, conditions are created which allow the patient to be
              removed from the ventilator for about ten minutes to see if they
              show any sign of attempting to breathe on their own. Patients who
              are brain stem dead will not react in any way to any of the tests.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">
              This group of tests is carried out twice at separate times. They
              are done by two senior doctors with special expertise in this
              area, neither of whom must be a member of the transplant team.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">
              If the second set of tests confirms no evidence of brain stem
              activity, the patient is declared dead.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">
              The standards for certifying death by brain stem death are strict
              and accepted medically, legally, and ethically in the UK and in
              most other countries.

              Organ and Tissue Donation – Your Questions Answered
            </h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">
              Kidney Transplant in Delhi is one of the most miraculous
              achievements of modern medicine. But they depend entirely on the
              generosity of donors and their families who are willing to make
              this life-saving or life-enhancing gift to others.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">
              One donor can save the lives of several people, restore the sight
              of two others, and improve the quality of life of many more. The
              more people who pledge to donate their organs and tissue after
              their death, the more people stand to benefit. By choosing to join
              the NHS Organ Donor Register, you could help make sure life goes
              on for many others.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">
              Joining the register records your agreement to the use of your
              organs and tissue for transplantation after your death.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">
              When you register, it is important that you tell those closest to
              you about your decision.

                <p class="text-gray-600">
                  Organ donation is the gift of an organ to help someone who
                  needs a transplant. The generosity of donors and their
                  families enables over 3,000 people in India every year to take
                  on a new lease of life.

                  The first successful kidney transplant was in 1954. The first
                  heart transplant took place in 1967.

                  Kidneys, heart, liver, lungs, pancreas, and the small bowel
                  can all be transplanted. Techniques are improving all the time
                  and we may soon be able to transplant other parts of the body
                  to help even more people.

                <p class="text-gray-600">
                  Tissue donation is the gift of tissues such as corneas, skin,
                  bone, tendons, cartilage, and heart valves to help others.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-600">
                  The first successful cornea transplant was in 1905. Every
                  year, thousands of people with a severe eye disease or injury
                  have their sight restored by donated corneas. Bone, tendons,
                  and cartilage are used for reconstruction after an injury or
                  during joint replacement surgery. A bone transplant can
                  prevent limb amputation in patients suffering from bone
                  cancer. Heart valves are used to help children born with heart
                  defects and adults with diseased or damaged valves. Skin
                  grafts are used to treat people with severe burns.
