        <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #34495e;">
            The <strong>kidneys</strong> are bean-shaped organs, each about the size of our fist. The two kidneys are located at the center of the body, at the back, on either side of the spine. Each kidney is made up of small complex units called 
            <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #e74c3c;">nephrons</span>. Each kidney contains about 1 million nephrons.
        </p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #34495e;">
            The kidneys excrete metabolic waste products like urea, creatinine, hydrogen, potassium, and excess water through urine. The urine formation occurs continuously in the kidneys and is transported to the collection center called the 
            <strong>urinary bladder</strong> via two drain pipelines called 
            <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #e74c3c;">ureters</span>.
        </p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #34495e;">
            At an opportune moment, the urine can be voided through the <strong>urethra</strong>, the terminal part of this effluent outlet. A 
            <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #e74c3c;">sphincter</span> prevents the involuntary passage of urine.
        </p>

        <h1 style="text-align: center; color: #2c3e50; font-weight: bold; font-size: 30px; padding: 10px;">Functions of the Kidneys</h1>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #34495e;">The kidneys perform many vital functions to maintain a clean and healthy internal environment:</p>
        <ul style="line-height: 1.6; color: #34495e;">
            <li>Keeps the internal environment of our body clean and healthy</li>
            <li>Excretes the metabolic waste products of food, especially nitrogenous waste</li>
            <li>Produces <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #e74c3c;">erythropoietin</span>, a hormone that helps in blood formation</li>
            <li>Excretes metabolic acids and other toxic compounds</li>
            <li>Contributes to healthy bone formation by making active vitamin D</li>
            <li>In chronic kidney disease, both kidneys lose their functions, leading to various health problems</li>
        </ul>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #34495e;">The most important point to remember is that even up to advanced stages of kidney failure, like CKD stages IV and V, patients often do not show any symptoms.</p>

        <h2 style="color: #2c3e50;">Early Symptoms of Kidney Failure</h2>

        <ul style="line-height: 1.6; color: #34495e;">
            <li>Polyuria (passing more urine) – paradoxical!</li>
            <li>Nocturia (passing more urine during the night)</li>
            <li>Pedal edema (swelling of the feet), puffiness of the face</li>
            <li>Persistent aches and pains</li>
            <li>High blood pressure</li>
            <li>Shortness of breath with mild exertion</li>
            <li>Inability to complete the family</li>
            <li>Fatigue, lassitude, and tiredness</li>
        </ul>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #34495e;">It is important to note that many of these symptoms can be caused by other health issues, not just kidney disease. The only way to determine the cause is to visit your nephrologist in Delhi, India.</p>

        <h1 style="text-align: center; color: #2c3e50; font-weight: bold; font-size: 30px; padding: 10px;">Investigation</h1>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #34495e;">The diagnosis of kidney disease is made through various tests, including:</p>

        <ul style="line-height: 1.6; color: #34495e;">
            <li><strong>Blood tests</strong> – Serum Creatinine, Blood Urea</li>
            <li><strong>Urine R/M and Microalbumin</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Ultrasound scan of the kidneys</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #34495e;">
            Urine examination may reveal the loss of protein in urine, with or without the presence of red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), etc. Blood investigations often show elevated urea, serum creatinine, and electrolyte imbalances, along with divalent ion disturbances.
        </p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #34495e;">
            Ultrasound of the abdomen may show small, shrunken kidneys. However, it is important to note that in many patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), the kidney size may remain normal.
        </p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #34495e;">
            A normal ultrasound for kidneys does not rule out CKD, especially in diabetics who may have advanced kidney disease despite the appearance of normal kidney size.

        <h2 style="color: #2c3e50;">Choosing Between Hemodialysis and Peritoneal Dialysis</h2>
        <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #34495e;">
            The choice between <strong>hemodialysis</strong> or <strong>peritoneal dialysis</strong> is influenced by various factors such as availability, convenience, underlying medical conditions, home situation, and age. This decision is best made by discussing the risks and benefits of each type of dialysis with your dialysis specialist in Delhi and his support staff.
        </p>

        <h2 style="color: #2c3e50;">When to Start Dialysis?</h2>
        <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #34495e;">
            Nephrologists in Delhi recommend that dialysis begin before kidney disease progresses to the point of life-threatening complications affecting the brain, heart, and lungs. If dialysis is started too late, the quality of life may not significantly improve even after regular treatments.
        </p>

        <h2 style="color: #2c3e50;">Emergency Dialysis</h2>
        <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #34495e;">
            Emergency dialysis is typically given under the following conditions:
        </p>
        <ul style="line-height: 1.6; color: #34495e;">
            <li>Blood tests reveal very high BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen) or serum creatinine levels</li>
            <li>Severe shortness of breath due to fluid overload</li>
            <li>Severe metabolic acidosis</li>
            <li>Life-threatening hyperkalemia (high potassium levels in the blood)</li>
            <li>Bleeding diathesis caused by uremia</li>
            <li>Pericarditis (fluid collection around the heart)</li>
            <li>Altered mental state or motor weakness due to nerve involvement</li>
        </ul>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #34495e;">
            It is advisable to opt for early elective dialysis and avoid waiting for an emergency. Emergency dialysis carries higher risks of mortality and morbidity.

        <h2 style="color: #2c3e50;">Home Hemodialysis</h2>
        <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #34495e;">
            In many foreign countries, patients and their relatives are taught how to perform <strong>hemodialysis</strong> at home, usually at night before sleeping. This can be done anywhere from 3 to 7 nights a week. To perform home hemodialysis, one needs to arrange for:
        </p>
        <ul style="line-height: 1.6; color: #34495e;">
            <li>A hemodialysis machine</li>
            <li>A water supply unit</li>
            <li>Disposable supplies, medicines, and chemicals</li>
            <li>A separate room for the procedure</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #34495e;">
            Patients stay connected with their dialysis center in Delhi through telemetry or other means for regular monitoring and assistance.
        </p>

        <h2 style="color: #2c3e50;">Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis (CAPD)</h2>
        <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #34495e;">
            CAPD is more commonly practiced in India. In this procedure, a small plastic catheter is inserted into the patient's abdomen via a simple surgery. The patient and their attendants are taught how to:
        </p>
        <ul style="line-height: 1.6; color: #34495e;">
            <li>Instill dialysis fluid into the abdomen through the catheter</li>
            <li>Drain the used fluid four hours later</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #34495e;">
            This process must be done three times a day, taking all necessary precautions.
        </p>

        <h2 style="color: #2c3e50;">Advantages of CAPD</h2>
        <ul style="line-height: 1.6; color: #34495e;">
            <li>It can be done in the comfort of the home, saving time, money, and energy that would otherwise be spent traveling to the hospital for hemodialysis.</li>
            <li>There is less need for blood transfusion.</li>
            <li>Fewer restrictions on food and fluid intake are required.</li>
            <li>The patient can maintain a more normal lifestyle.</li>
        </ul>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #34495e;">
            A <strong>kidney transplant</strong> in Delhi is the treatment of choice for many patients with end-stage renal disease. A successful kidney transplant can significantly improve the quality of life. However, not all patients are suitable candidates for this therapy due to its risks and limitations.
        </p>

        <h2 style="color: #2c3e50;">Donor Requirements</h2>
        <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #34495e;">
            The donor should be healthy, have the same blood group as the patient, and preferably be a close blood relative. Unfortunately, there is a significant shortage of organ donors, making it a challenge for many patients.
        </p>

        <h2 style="color: #2c3e50;">Post-Transplant Care</h2>
        <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #34495e;">
            After a successful transplant, patients are required to take lifelong medications and undergo periodic checkups with a kidney specialist in Delhi. These measures are essential to prevent the rejection of the transplanted kidney and ensure long-term health.

        <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #34495e;">
            Once it is determined that a <strong>kidney transplant</strong> will be required, the patient, along with their physician, should carefully consider the advantages and disadvantages of three types of therapy:
        </p>

        <ul style="line-height: 1.6; color: #34495e;">
            <li><strong>Hemodialysis</strong> (in the hospital or at home)</li>
            <li><strong>Peritoneal Dialysis</strong> at home (CAPD)</li>
            <li><strong>Renal Transplantation</strong> (living donor or deceased organ donor, also called cadaveric donor)</li>
        </ul>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #34495e;">
            A <strong>kidney transplant</strong> in Delhi is typically required for severe kidney failure, also known as stage V chronic kidney disease or <strong>end-stage renal disease (ESRD)</strong>. At this stage, the kidneys are no longer functioning effectively, and waste products, as well as fluid, begin to build up in the blood.
        </p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #34495e;">
            Dialysis helps take over a portion of the failing kidneys' function by removing excess fluid and waste from the body. It is usually needed when 90% or more of kidney function is lost.

        <h1 style="text-align: center; color: #2c3e50; font-weight: bold; font-size: 30px; padding: 10px;">Diet</h1>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #34495e;">
            Dr. Sunil Prakash, the best nephrologist in Delhi, India, emphasizes that diet plays a crucial role in managing kidney disease. A balanced diet is essential for maintaining health while avoiding excess protein load on your struggling kidneys.
        </p>

        <h2 style="color: #2c3e50;">Protein Regulation</h2>
        <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #34495e;">
            - In the early (pre-dialysis) stage, the protein requirement is <strong>0.6 gm/kg</strong> of body weight. For an average Indian weighing around 50 kg, this translates to <strong>30-35 grams</strong> of high-quality dietary proteins per day.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #34495e;">
            - However, patients on dialysis require <strong>1.2-1.3 gm/kg</strong> of body weight, focusing on high biological value proteins such as:
        </p>
        <ul style="line-height: 1.6; color: #34495e;">
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Chicken</li>
            <li>Meat</li>
            <li>Fish</li>
            <li>Paneer/Milk products</li>
            <li>Soybean</li>
            <li>Pulses</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 style="color: #2c3e50;">Potassium Restriction</h2>
        <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #34495e;">
            Potassium intake should be limited as it is present in high amounts in fruits, nuts, and green vegetables. Potassium can be reduced in vegetables by leeching them.
        </p>

        <h2 style="color: #2c3e50;">Sodium Restriction</h2>
        <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #34495e;">
            To decrease sodium content in the diet:
        </p>
        <ul style="line-height: 1.6; color: #34495e;">
            <li>Do not add salt during cooking or at the table.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 style="color: #2c3e50;">Foods to Avoid</h2>
        <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #34495e;">
            Avoid the following:
        </p>
        <ul style="line-height: 1.6; color: #34495e;">
            <li>Cakes, pastries, biscuits, and squash</li>
            <li>Papads, pickles, salted chips, nuts, and popcorn</li>
            <li>Commercial soft drinks and proprietary drinks (high in sodium/potassium)</li>
            <li>Dried foods like fish and fruits; readymade soups and canned foods</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 style="color: #2c3e50;">Foods That Can Be Eaten Freely</h2>
        <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #34495e;">
            These foods are low in protein and potassium and high in calories:
        </p>
        <ul style="line-height: 1.6; color: #34495e;">
