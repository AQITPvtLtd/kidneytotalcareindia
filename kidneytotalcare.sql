21px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong><strong>Urinary incontinence of effort.&nbsp;</strong></strong>The loss of urine occurs when you laugh, sneeze, practice an exercise, gain weight or simply stand up.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"color: rgb(42, 42, 42);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);font-size: 21px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">The frequency and severity of losses vary

jet.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"color: rgb(42, 42, 42);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);font-size: 21px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">The origin of this type of incontinence occurs when making an effort increases the pressure in the abdomen and bladder.&nbsp;This causes the urine to exit involuntarily through the urethra (the tube where urine exits to the outside), especially when the support to the urethra is weakened.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"color: rgb(42, 42, 42);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);font-size: 21px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong><strong>Urinary incontinence of urgency.&nbsp;</strong></strong>There are people who suddenly feel a strong urge to urinate without being able to control it (urgency).&nbsp;This symptom is usually accompanied by an increase in urinary frequency, both day and night (nocturia).&nbsp;The person who suffers urinary urgency is unable, in many cases, to retain urine before reaching the bathroom.</span></p>\r\n<p

255);font-size: 21px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong><strong>Genetics.&nbsp;</strong></strong>Some women are born with a pelvic floor musculature that is weaker or more susceptible to weakening.&nbsp;There is a greater chance of incontinence if there is a family history.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"color: rgb(42, 42, 42);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);font-size: 21px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong><strong>Pregnancy.&nbsp;</strong></strong>The hormones released during pregnancy relax the tissues and produce stretching of the pelvic floor muscles.&nbsp;In addition, the increase in weight as the baby grows affects the pelvic floor musculature at the time of maintaining the continence function optimally.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"color: rgb(42, 42, 42);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);font-size: 21px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong><strong>Parto.&nbsp;</strong></strong>During childbirth, the pelvic floor muscles that hold the bladder, vagina, and rectum, suffer the maximum stretch possible due to the pressure exerted on the head of the baby to descend to exit through the vagina.&nbsp;In some women, these muscles and the tissues that surround them, can be permanently laxer, and weaken these structures that lead to urinary and anal incontinence.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"color: rgb(42, 42, 42);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);font-size: 21px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong><strong>Menopause.&nbsp;</strong></strong>In this stage of life, due to hormonal change, different changes can occur that precipitate or aggravate the symptoms of incontinence and other pelvic floor problems.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"color: rgb(42, 42, 42);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);font-size: 21px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong><strong>Gynecological surgery.&nbsp;</strong></strong>A gynecological surgery, such as extirpation of the uterus (hysterectomy), or other therapeutic procedures at the pelvic level, such as&nbsp;radiation therapy, may cause alterations of the nerves or anatomical structures that maintain continence.&nbsp;These variations can precipitate or aggravate the symptoms of urinary incontinence or cause a feeling of a bulge in the genitals by the descent of the pelvic organs (prolapse).</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"color: rgb(42, 42, 42);background-color: rgb(255, 255,

255);font-size: 21px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong><strong>Obesity.&nbsp;</strong></strong>It is demonstrated that overweight and&nbsp;obesity&nbsp;are risk factors for stress urinary incontinence, due to the increase of pressure inside the abdomen and, therefore, over the bladder.&nbsp;This effect can also contribute to the appearance or worsening of other problems related to the pelvic floor, such as the descent of the pelvic organs (prolapse) or urge urinary incontinence.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"color: rgb(42, 42, 42);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);font-size: 21px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong><strong>Chronic constipation.&nbsp;</strong></strong>The increase of the abdominal efforts to obtain the correct evacuation exerts pressure on the pelvic structures and distension on the pelvic floor musculature, which causes it to weaken.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"color: rgb(42, 42, 42);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);font-size: 21px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong><strong>Tobacco.&nbsp;</strong></strong>There is evidence that tobacco is a risk factor for stress urinary incontinence since its habitual consumption favors the appearance of chronic cough and this causes an increase in abdominal pressure.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"color: rgb(42, 42, 42);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);font-size: 21px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong><strong>Bladder stimulants.&nbsp;</strong></strong>The excessive intake of some substances (caffeine, alcoholic beverages, soft drinks, and sweeteners) produce an excessive stimulation of the bladder, which worsens the symptoms of urgency and increases the urge to go to the bathroom.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"color: rgb(42, 42, 42);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);font-size: 21px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong><strong>Drinking a lot.&nbsp;</strong></strong>Excessive intake of fluids (more than 1.5 liters per day) can condition the onset or worsen of incontinence.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"color: rgb(42, 42, 42);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);font-size: 21px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong><strong>Physical efforts.&nbsp;</strong></strong>Some of the behaviors that are performed during the day involve repeated physical efforts, whether at work, hobbies, body posture, etc.&nbsp;This conditions an increase in abdominal pressure and overload of the pelvic floor structures, which can precipitate or aggravate the symptoms of stress incontinence.&nbsp;They have more risk, women who practice impact sports, stop and start sports, weights, push-ups, etc.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"color: rgb(42, 42, 42);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);font-size: 21px;\"><span style=\"font-size:

style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Sometimes, women who experience urinary incontinence do not give&nbsp;importance because it occurs very occasionally, in very small amounts, or, it does not interfere with their well-being, so they do not need to consult or receive any treatment.&nbsp;In contrast, in other women, urinary incontinence is a detriment and, therefore, they need to know the treatment options available for each type of incontinence.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"color: rgb(42, 42, 42);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);font-size: 21px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">A high percentage of

style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong><strong>Lose weight.&nbsp;</strong></strong>In women who are overweight or&nbsp;obese, it is shown that a weight reduction of between 5 and 10% can reduce the episodes of weekly urinary incontinence by up to 50%.&nbsp;For this reason, it is recommended to lose weight with the help of diet and exercise.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"color: rgb(42, 42, 42);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);font-size: 21px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong><strong>Improve intestinal transit.&nbsp;</strong></strong>Decrease the efforts to defecate with

255);font-size: 21px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong><strong>Give up smoking.&nbsp;</strong></strong>Chronic cough decreases, so episodes of urinary incontinence will be less frequent since there is less impact on the muscles of the pelvic floor.&nbsp;In addition, tobacco acts as a bladder stimulant, so it will also improve symptoms of urgency.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"color: rgb(42, 42, 42);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);font-size: 21px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong><strong>Reduce or eliminate the use of bladder stimulants.&nbsp;</strong></strong>Coffee and tea, alcohol, soft drinks, sweetened drinks, energy drinks, etc., produce spasms in the bladder.&nbsp;Reducing its consumption is beneficial for those women who have symptoms of urgency and increased urination frequency.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"color: rgb(42, 42, 42);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);font-size: 21px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong><strong>Moderate fluid intake.&nbsp;</strong></strong>The adequate consumption of liquids should be around 1.5 liters a day.&nbsp;It must be taken into account that a balanced diet already contributes a part of the necessary hydration.&nbsp;Therefore, people with urgency or nighttime incontinence should avoid drinking liquids after mid-afternoon.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"color:

daily physical exercise.&nbsp;However, those women with stress urinary incontinence, or with significant muscle weakness, should avoid making physical efforts that pose a risk to the pelvic floor musculature.&nbsp;In this sense, exercises such as walking, swimming and all those that help to acquire a good physical shape without causing abdominal pressure are recommended.</span></p>\r\n<p
